FAQ
---------------------------------------------
Q: The import is not fully working. Its breaking after XXX lines

A: Thats easy: Add a new .htaccess file, include the following lines:
php_value suhosin.request.max_vars 2048
php_value suhosin.post.max_vars 2048
This is not working in all configs, but might help. Its the "security Feature" of
the hardened PHP Code...

Q: I cannot see the settings in the ACP or the links in the header. The
Plugin must be broken

A: No. You have to set the permissions for guests AND every single user registered
in the DKP

Q: I want the raidbanker to translate the items on import
A: Download a copy of the itemlist.xml and upload it to raidbanker/include/. Thats all.

Q: I want guests to see the XYZ-plugin
A: Go to the ACP, general settings. There are the global permissions", these are for the guests

Q: i got an error on line 200 or 205
A: This is a template error. Please make shure that all templates are installed right, 
that you uploaded all templates. error 205: delete the template folder and reupload it.
error 200: download the default template, name it like your eqdkp template folder (if you're
using a custom template which is locatet in the folder "blubb", rename the default folder included
in the zip file of this addon to "blubb").
